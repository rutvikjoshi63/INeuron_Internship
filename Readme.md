# Problem Statement:
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we
need for acceptable compressive strength.

# Workflow & Environment Setup 
## Create a repository on github and connect with your local and add Readme.md file
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git status
git remote add origin git@github.com:rutvikjoshi63/INeuron_Internship.git
```

## Create a new virtual environment
### Deactivate current(base) environment
```
conda create -p CCStrength_Prediction python==3.9 -y
```
## Create a new requirement.txt file 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Create app.py file to execute on Flask 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
