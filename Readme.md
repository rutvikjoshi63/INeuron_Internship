## Problem Statement:
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we
need for acceptable compressive strength.

## Software and Tools Requirements
1. [Github Account](https://github.com)
2. [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Heroku Account](https://heroku.com)
4. [Git Cli](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)

## Workflow & Environment Setup 
### Create a new virtual environment
### Deactivate current(base) environment
```
conda create -p CCStrength_Prediction python==3.9 -y
```
### Create a new requirement.txt file 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Create app.py file to execute on Flask 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
